    <h1>External CSS</h1>
    <p>Unlike other css methods this is different.  
        <br/> We use this method because it makes our
        code more cleaner and easier to read.Also it is easy to create everything differently.
        <br/> everything is in the new file with extenstion .css hence the code is cleaner.
